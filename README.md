# ADHelper
A little tool I wrote to make lookups in Active Directory easier.

Pre-Requisite is that you need to install the activedirectory module in PowerShell

Easiest way to use is to place the adhelper.ps1 file in the directory you run PowerShell from as admin (default is "C:\Windows\System32") and dot source the file

Example in PowerShell:

C:\Windows\System32> . ./adhelper.ps1
